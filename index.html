            <h3>San Diego, America's Finest City</h3>
            <p>
              San Diego is a city in southern California with gorgeous weather
              and stunning beaches. However, San Diego is known for the San
              Diego Zoo, San Diego Padres, and more recently, its craft beer
              industry, also make this a famous city worth visiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              San Diego is often referred to as "America's Finest City" due to
              its beautiful beaches, great weather, and many tourist
              attractions. However, this nickname is not an official designation
              and is often used as a marketing slogan.
